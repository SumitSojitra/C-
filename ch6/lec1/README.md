**<u>Aim 1</u> :** WAP to find sum of all three numberâ€™s cubes by
implementing single level inheritance: Class X->Class Y
- Class X has following members: a, b & c attributes in
integer data type
- Class Y has following members: setData() and
getData() methods

**<u>Program :</u>** ch6_1-1.cpp

**<u>Aim 2</u> :** WAP to convert given degree celsius temperature into
fahrenheit and convert that fahrenheit temperature
into kelvin by implementing multilevel inheritance:
Class P -> Class Q -> Class R
- Class P has following members: temperature
attribute in float
- Class Q has following members: toFehrenheit()
method
- Class R has following members: toKelvin() method
