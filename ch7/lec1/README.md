CH 7 : POLYMORPHISM
=========================

## **<u>Lecture 1 :**</u>

**<u>Aim 1</u> :** WWAP to perform all basic arithmetic operations such
like +, -, *, and / operations by implementing method
overloading using total 2 classes.
- use only one method named calculate() in child
class
- if you pass 2 arguments, perform division
- if you pass 3 arguments, perform subtraction
- if you pass 4 arguments, perform multiplication
- if you pass 5 arguments, perform addition

**<u>Program :</u>** ch7_1-1.cpp

**<u>Output :</u>**

**<u>Aim 2</u> :** WAP to implement method overriding by following
below mentioned criteria:
- Class Cricket -> Class T20Match
- Class Cricket -> Class TestMatch
- override getTotalOvers() method in both classes

**<u>Program :</u>** ch7_1-2.cpp
